# siliconshells_first.github.io
My website
I first published it as siliconshells.github.io and changed the name so now it's hosted at siliconshells.github.io/siliconshells_first.github.io. 
I can still use siliconshells.github.io
That's how to host a whole repository as a sub for another site. Like the admin part of a webbapp
